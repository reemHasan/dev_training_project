#### Client/server 
An architecture in which the user's PC (the client) is the requesting machine and the server is the supplying machine, both of which are connected via a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN) such as the Internet.

#### The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET)
     was the first wide-area packet-switching network with distributed control and one of the first networks to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite. Both technologies became the technical foundation of the Internet. The ARPANET was established by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of Defense.

#### OSI – Open Systems Interconnection:
        “est un modèle de communications entre ordinateurs. Il décrit les fonctionnalités nécessaires à la communication et l’organisation de ces fonctions” 
#### WAMP stands for Windows (operating system), Apache (webserver), MySQL (database), and PHP (coding language)
    ***WAMP*** is a localhost server for Windows Operating Systems that lets you manage, create, test, and develop websites without having to use a remote web server. We can use the WAMP server to create a local environment that allows us to work offline, i.e. do experiment with code, plugins, design, as well as test the different features of our website before taking it live.
    ***The abbreviations in details*** 
    “W” stands for Windows, there’s also LAMP (for Linux) and MAMP (for Mac).

    “A” stands for Apache. Apache is the server software that is responsible for serving web pages. When you request a page to be seen by you, Apache grants your request over HTTP and shows you the site.

    “M” stands for MySQL. MySQL’s job is to be the database management system for your server. It stores all of the relevant information like your site’s content, user profiles, etc.

    “P” stands for PHP. It’s the programming language that was used to write WordPress. It acts like glue for this whole software stack. PHP is running in conjunction with Apache and communicating with MySQL.

        ***WordPress*** is only one of the site builders and content management systems users can download and install for free, but it has unique features that make it the most popular content management system in use today. WordPress tops the list of most often used site building packages in the world. 
        But, both Joomla and Drupal require a certain level of technical know-how and familiarity with HTML CSS and the programming language PHP. WordPress allows experienced users to work at a certain level of technical know-how and familiarity with HTML CSS and the programming language PH, —but, it also includes features for beginners, so that they can set up a site quickly with no knowledge of code or programming.
